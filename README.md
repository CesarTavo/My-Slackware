# My Slackware

# Installation

Maybe you want to read this text before using Slackware [Instalar-slackware-sin-morir-en-el-intento](https://www.ochobitshacenunbyte.com/2015/11/18/instalar-slackware-sin-morir-intento/
)

For the installation you have to download the iso from the official page
[slackware-iso](https://mirrors.slackware.com/slackware/slackware-iso/
)
and after make an bootteable USB.

My installation is very simple. But you can make an LVM installation or make
a disk encryption.

For LVM check this: [LVM-slackware](http://www.slackware.com/~alien/archive/13.1/README_LVM.TXT)

For disk encryption check: [encryption-disk](https://blog.darknedgy.net/technology/2014/07/27/1/)
